The Complexity of Moving from MODS to RDF
=========================================

The MODS RDF Ontology
---------------------

When moving from MODS XML to RDF and linked data, it makes sense to consider migrating your XML to the `MODS RDF ontology <https://github.com/blunalucero/MODS-RDF/>`_.
While the ontology is functional, it has issues that make its adoption problematic. As the Samvera MODS to RDF working
group explains, the problems include a "lack of active maintenance, heavy reliance on the use of blank nodes and/or
minted objects in its implementation, and perhaps most importantly a lack of adoption." [1]_
