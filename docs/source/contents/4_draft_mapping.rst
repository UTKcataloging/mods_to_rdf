UTK MODS to RDF Mapping
#######################

***********
Style Guide
***********

This document aims to provide all of the information a member of Digital Initiatives needs to transform UT’s existing
MODS XML to RDF, regardless of the platform chosen. In order to achieve this goal in a consistent and accessible manner,
we will compose the mapping document according to the following practices.

The document will be structured according to `MODS top level elements <https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/generalapp.html>`_
and provide examples of use cases associated with each element. For each use case, example XML for the element being mapped,
along with a link to the full MODS record, should be included. Turtle notation, with semicolons separating separate statements
about the same subject, will be used as the RDF serialization format. All of the namespaces used as prefixes in the example
turtle should be included so that it can be validated. RDF should use example.org "URIs" that include a number (use /1 for
the first instance of a minted URI in each example, as though each individual example section is independent of all the others).
For more complex examples, graphs illustrating the RDF should also be included to make the relationships more easily understood.
More complex examples might include those with minted object or elements that include several relationships (like a geographic
subject with coordinates). Graphs should not be necessary for the RDF representing flat elements, like abstract.

Beyond the focused attention on individual elements, the document will also include broader examples and information. A
section listing all prefixes used will be present as well as a complete example of a single MODS record transformed
according to the guide’s specifications. The elements are listed in the order outlined on `DLTN technical documentation
<https://dltn-technical-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style/xsl.html>`_.

Simple Example
==============

`Example record - knoxgardens:115 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/knoxgardens%3A115/datastream/MODS>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <abstract>Photograph slide of the Tennessee state tree, the tulip tree</abstract>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

        <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:abstract "Photograph slide of the Tennessee state tree, the tulip tree" .

Local Identifiers
-----------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This is the catch-all category for identifiers that is important to keep but that do not need to be separated into individual
categories for discovery. UT's adminDB values as well as a range of different locally created identifiers are present.
A great deal of the values were initially created by Special Collections in finding aids - for instance identifiers with a
type attribute of "slide number", "archival number", "cw", and "film number". If an identifier type attribute of "opac" is
present, this means that the resource also has a full MARC record present in the Alma catalog. The strings values for opac
identifiers are fourteen to sixteen digits, with the last five digits always being ‘02311.' The PID value is the main
identifier within the Islandora7 platform and is present in the records of collections that have undergone remediation.
Collections that were migrated from Omeka to Islandora7 often include identifiers with a type of "spc." These collections
include the Anna Catherine Wiley Sketches, Images of East Tennessee, and Photographs of the Ruskin Cooperative Association.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These values are being kept because they may be helpful to users in finding specific materials. For instance, while :code:`@type="pid"`
identifiers will no longer be the primary identifiers on UT's next digital collections platform, they could be used to
identify cited resources that have broken links. Many of the identifiers associated with Special Collections allow users
to see how the same resource might be referenced within finding aids. Have :code:`@type="opac"` identifiers helps staff at UT
know immediately whether a resource has a MARC record, which could prove useful if descriptive metadata is needed in this
form. Overall, little effort needs to be exerted to keep all of these values and they all have the potential to be helpful
in the future.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`identifier[@type="Vendor ID"]` OR

:code:`identifier[@type="archival number"]` OR

:code:`identifier[@type="catalog"]` OR

:code:`identifier[@type="circular"]` OR

:code:`identifier[@type="cw"]` OR

    @prefix identifiers: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/identifiers/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        identifiers:local "Circular 79" .

Acquisition Identifier
----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Several of UT's collections come from institutions outside the library and include identifiers assigned by those
institutions. The McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture on campus is one of these institutions. In the `Nineteenth
and Early Twentieth Century Images of Egypt collection <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/collections%3Aegypt>`_ shared by McClung, traditional museum acquisition numbers
consisting of the year three numbers separated by periods (year.acquisition group.item) are present.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both OpaqueNamespace and `CIDOC-CRM <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/>`_ properties were considered for mapping these values.
Both `opaque:accessionNumber <http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/cco_accessionNumber>`_ and `crm:E8 (Acquisition) <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E8_Acquisition>`_ were defined
appropriately for UT's use cases. Because CIDOC-CRM is particularly used in a museum context, we decided to use
`opaque:accessionNumber` as it is arguably more flexible. This allows us to use the same property for accession numbers
from a wide variety of institutions. Both properties support content negotiation.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`identifier[@type="acquisition"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The property `opaque:accessionNumber` was selected.

`Example record - egypt:10 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/egypt%3A10/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

<identifier type="acquisition">1996.10.1</identifier>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix opaque: <http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
            opaque:accessionNumber "1996.10.1" .

OCLC numbers
------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Records from the Tennessee Documentary History collection include OCLC identifiers. These values can be used to identify
corresponding records in Worldcat.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OCLC identifiers could be useful if these materials are ever shared with HathiTrust, as this value is a requirement for
submission. Only one property, `dbo:oclc`, was identified to use and it aligns with our philosophy guidelines.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`identifier[@type="oclc"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - tdh:989 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh:989/datastream/MODS>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <identifier type="oclc">44394278</identifier>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        dbo:oclc "44394278" .

ISSNs
-----

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Approximately 10% of our records describe periodicals. Effort has been invested in establishing official e-ISSNs for several
titles through the Library of Congress. These titles include:

1. Agricultural & Home Economics News
2. Agricultural & Home Economics Packet
3. Agricultural News
4. Alumnus
5. Circular
6. Farm News
7. Phoenix
8. Special Circular
9. Tennessee Farm and Home News
10. Tennessee Farm and Home Science
11. Tennessee Farm News
12. Torchbearer

* Note: Some resources within the Children's Defense Fund collection have both a ISSN and a ISBN.

More information on assigning an e-ISSN can be found here - https://www.loc.gov/issn/basics/basics-brochure-eserials.html.

UT currently has a specific Solr field for publication identifiers (ISBNs and ISSNs) so that these identifiers can be
displayed and searched for separately: utk_mods_publication_identifier_ms.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As these identifiers have meaning outside of the context of UT and might be used by patrons
in a search to find these materials, it is important that we continue to support a unique field for these values rather
than including them in a generic identifier category with other types of identifier values. In addition,
having a persistent link for resources with a particular ISSN is essential to the Libraries' HathiTrust submission
records. A title-level MARC XML record with a link to all issues with the same ISSN is shared for this purpose.

Properties for ISSN values are established in DBpedia and the Standard Identifiers Scheme. Both follow our philosophy
guidelines and could be used to accurately represent the ISSN values. Ultimately we decided to use DBpedia because it is
a widely used core ontology whereas the Standard Identifiers Scheme is more library specific.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`identifier[@type="issn"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - agrutesc:2130 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/agrutesc:2130/datastream/MODS>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <identifier type="issn">2687-7325</identifier>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        dbo:issn "2687-7325" .

ISBNs
-----

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

International Standard Book Numbers are present as identifier values in the Children's Defense Fund collection. UT
currently has a specific Solr field for publication identifiers (ISBNs and ISSNs) so that these identifiers can be
displayed and searched for separately: utk_mods_publication_identifier_ms.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As these identifiers have meaning outside of the context of UTK and might be used by patrons in a search to find these materials,
it is important that we continue to support a unique field for these values. Properties for ISBN values are established
in DBpedia and the Standard Identifiers Scheme. Because preference is given to core ontologies rather than library specific
ones, we selected `dbo:issn`.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`identifier[@type="isbn"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - cdf:6909 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/cdf:6909/datastream/MODS>`_

+-----------------------------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

titleInfo - one titleInfo element
---------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category refers to records with a single :code:`titleInfo` element. All records within UT's collections contain at
least one title value. Typically, in the case of traditional bibliographic materials, this value is transcribed
directly from the source (title page, etc.). In UT's collections, :code:`titleInfo/title` is not restricted to transcribed
titles only and also contains supplied title strings constructed by the cataloger.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Titles are required values for DPLA and are used as the main way of identifying a resource within Islandora, PrimoVE, and
Worldcat, so it is essential that these values are kept. This mapping document consistently designates the displayed
title as the primary title rather than privileging transcribed titles. Currently within Islandora, the fgsLabel is by
default associated with the value within :code:`titleInfo/title`. Looking to possible future platforms, the equivalent
property for the title which is given preference by default in display is `dcterms:title`.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo/title`

Decision
^^^^^^^^
The string within :code:`titleInfo/title` can easily translate to the `dcterms:title` property. In the case below, the single
title value given is a supplied value (since there is no writing on the actual resource to transcribe). This shows the
inconsistency with which :code:`@supplied="yes"` is used.

`Example record - acwiley:280 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/acwiley%3A280/datastream/MODS>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo>
        <title>Pencil drawn portrait study of woman</title>
    </titleInfo>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:title "Pencil drawn portrait study of woman" .

titleInfo - single titleInfo element having a supplied attribute of yes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category refers to single :code:`titleInfo` element having an attribute of :code:`supplied="yes"`. :code:`titleInfo[@supplied="yes"]`
is used currently to indicate that a title is constructed by a cataloger rather than transcribed from the source. As mentioned
previously, this is not consistently used to indicate whether a title is supplied or not, particularly when the only title
value has to be supplied because the materials being described have no linguistic content to transcribe.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the title values themselves need to be retained, it was decided that it is not important to keep values within
:code:`titleInfo[@supplied="yes"]` separate from values within :code:`titleInfo` without the attribute value. Therefore both
single title values are mapped to the same property - `dcterms:title`. In traditional MARC records and in Samvera's mapping,
brackets are used to wrap title strings that are supplied as a way to distinguish supplied and transcribed titles within the
same field. The decision to not use brackets was made because these characters do not have intuitive meeting to users. This
decision is supported by the Digital Public Library of America's `Aggregation Overview document <https://www.njstatelib.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DPLA-Aggregation-Overview.pdf>`_
that recommends contributors do "not have brackets or ending periods" in their title values.


XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo[@supplied="yes"]/title`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Supplied titles will be represented as `dcterms:title`. Supplied titles will not be distinguished from transcribed titles
by using brackets. It is felt that this convention focuses more on cataloging conventions than on users' needs.

`Example record - hesler:10076 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/hesler%3A10076/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo supplied="yes">
        <title>Coprinus notebook 1</title>
    </titleInfo>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:title "Coprinus notebook 1" .

titleInfo - Multiple titleInfo elements with one having a supplied attribute of yes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category is defined by the presence of multiple :code:`titleInfo` elements and one having a attribute of :code:`supplied="yes"`.
Multiple :code:`titleInfo/title` values are typically present for materials where a title can be transcribed, but an additional
value is desired for display purposes. This is particularly prevalent for serial publications, in which titles often change
over time.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For consistency within collections, the best title to display for users is the supplied title. In current practice, collections
with supplied titles require that the fgsLabel be updated following ingest so that the value within :code:`titleInfo[@supplied="yes"]/title`
shows while browsing. It was decided to map these supplied titles to `dcterms:title` rather than `dcterms:alternative` so
that additional actions like fgsLabel updates are not necessary and to make description practices more easily align with
display practices.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo[@supplied="yes"]/title` AND

:code:`titleInfo/title`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

In cases where :code:`supplied="yes"` are present for one :code:`titleInfo` element the :code:`titleInfo[@supplied]/title` value will be used as `dcterms:title`.

`Example record - swim:162 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/swim:162/datastream/MODS/>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo>
        <title>Swimming 1969: The University of Tennessee </title>
    </titleInfo>
    <titleInfo supplied="yes">
        <title>University of Tennessee Swimming-Diving media guide, 1969</title>
    </titleInfo>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        dcterms:title "University of Tennessee Swimming-Diving media guide, 1969" ;
        dcterms:alternative "Swimming 1969: The University of Tennessee " .


titleInfo - titleInfo has partName sub-element
----------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category consists of records containing a :code:`titleInfo` element and sub-element of :code:`partName`.
The Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps collection contains the only records with :code:`partName`.


Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The values in :code:`partName` are essential to keep as they uniquely distinguish each map, but they do not need to be kept
distinct from the title. While they were historically separated because MODS had the granularity to define these values as
distinct from yet related to the title, this separation does not serve any practical purpose. For sharing with DPLA,
:code:`titleInfo/title` has to be concatenated to :code:`partName`. It therefore makes sense to remove this granularity
in UT's data itself to make it easier to share. Consistent with previous UT descriptive practices, commas rather than
periods will be used to indicate enumeration of an object within a string.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo/partName`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

In these cases the string contained in :code:`partName` will be appended to the :code:`title`. A ','
character followed by a space will be used as glue when concatenating the strings.

`Example record - sanborn:1194 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/sanborn:1194/datastream/MODS/>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo>
        <title>Knoxville -- 1917</title>
        <partName>Sheet 56</partName>
    </titleInfo>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:title "Knoxville -- 1917, Sheet 56" .

titleInfo - titleInfo has partNumber sub-element
------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category consists of 39 records that contain :code:`titleInfo/partNumber`. These records are all from the Phoenix collection.
Values within :code:`partNumber` share volume and issue numbers of the periodical.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Values within :code:`partNumber` should not be treated the same as :code:`partName` because :code:`titleInfo/title` values
within the Phoenix collection already include a season and year to enumerate them. Phoenix is an odd collection that includes
both volume/number and season/year. The volume/issue number is not included with the title because there are several
known instances where the numbers printed on the issue are inaccurate. Still, this information could be useful in identifying
an issue. Ultimately these values should be moved so that they are part of an alternative title for the resource - either
through remediation or during migration.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo/partNumber`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - phoenix:2236 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/phoenix%3A2236/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo supplied="yes">
        <title>Phoenix, fall 1968</title>
        <partNumber>volume 10, number 1</partNumber>
    </titleInfo>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:alternative "Phoenix, volume 10, number 1" .

titleInfo - titleInfo has nonSort sub-element
---------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category consists of records with a :code:`titleInfo` element and sub-element of :code:`nonSort`. The :code:`nonSort`
sub-element is used in MODS to mirror how the second indicator in a MARC title statement (245) is used to document nonfiling
characters ("A", "The", etc.). This removes definite or indefinite articles at the start of a title so that only significant
content within the string is used for sorting purposes.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The use of :code:`nonSort` is historical and the values do not need to be retained separately in a modern repository. Stop words
like "A" and "The" can be recognized for sorting purposes without being in a separate element. As the values present within
:code:`nonSort` are also part of the official title, when they are separated out into a sub-element within UT's repository,
work must be done to concatenate them to :code:`titleInfo/title` when sharing. This work is unnecessary and therefore
we will not retain :code:`nonSort` elements moving forward.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo/nonSort`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The string contained within the :code:`nonSort` element will be prepended to the :code:`title` value.

`Example record from volvoices:2890 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:2890/datastream/MODS/>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo>

titleInfo - Multiple titleInfo elements with one having a type of alternative
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category consists of records with two :code:`titleInfo` elements and one having an attribute of :code:`type="alternative"`.
This situation occurs when a resource has more than one title that can be transcribed from it.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resources are often known by more than one title, so including all known titles will help with discovery. It is important
for the title that is displayed as the main title to be separate from any secondary titles, so both need their own properties.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo` AND 

:code:`titleInfo[@type="alternative"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

:code:`titleInfo` elements with :code:`@type="alternative"` will defined as `dcterms:alternative`.

`Example record - utsmc:17870 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/utsmc%3A17870/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <titleInfo>
        <title>Prussian heroes march</title>

Abstracts that are not Blank Nodes
----------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

If a record has an :code:`abstract` or many :code:`abstract`\ s, they will each be mapped to `dcterms:abstract` as long as the :code:`abstract`
does not have an empty text node.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Regardless of the number, the value has the same semantic relationship to the object as it did in MODS. When more than
one :code:`abstract` value is present, these values will be kept as separate strings associated with `dcterms:abstract`.
This separation is desired because often the separate :code:`abstract` values contain information structured differently
from one another or information that comes from different sources (one abstract may be transcribed from the source while
another is supplied by the cataloger).

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`abstract[text()]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

If it has one :code:`abstract` like `gamble:124 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gamble%3A124/datastream/MODS>`_, map to `dcterms:abstract`.

.. code-block:: xml

    <abstract>
        Prosecutor John Keker gives his closing statement to the jury, explaining Col. John North's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair even though the majority of his statement is censored due to classified information.
    </abstract>

.. code-block:: turtle

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:abstract "Prosecutor John Keker gives his closing statement to the jury, explaining Col. John North's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair even though the majority of his statement is censored due to classified information." .

If it has more than one :code:`abstract` like `1001:1 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/1001%3A1/datastream/MODS>`_,
we will still map to `dcterms:abstract`.

.. code-block:: xml

    <abstract>

    <abstract>
        The hardwood forest of America, and probably of the entire world, originated in the Great Smoky Mountains, where remains the nation's largest body of virgin hardwood forest, and the world's greatest variety of trees, flowering shrubs and wild flowers.

Blank Abstracts
---------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

UT has a fair number of records with empty :code:`abstract`\ s. These likely were unintentionally added while using Islandora
forms or transforming XML with XSLT.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an :code:`abstract` is an empty node, do not map it. The value of the text node has no semantic meaning or value so there is no content to retain.

XPaths
^^^^^^

:code:`abstract[string()=""]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Don't map!

`Example record - roth:1595 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/roth%3A1595/datastream/MODS/view>`

.. code-block:: xml

    </abstract>

tableOfContents
===============

Use Case
--------

The following collections include :code:`tableOfContents` - David Van Vactor Music Collection, Tennessee Farm and Home Science,
The Arrow of Pi Beta Phi. There are a total of 455 unique values. This element contains the names of individually titled
parts that make up the larger resource. It is used to provide more detailed information on the content of a resource in
a non-structured way. Note that punctuation separating part titles varies depending on the string values being separated.
The following punctuation is present in UT's :code:`tableOfContents` elements: " -- ", " - ", and ";".

Justification
-------------

This information aides keyword discovery by adding more text to the record and providing users with a listing of parts
within the larger resource.

XPath
-----

:code:`tableOfContents`

Decision
--------

Below are examples showing the punctuation variations present in this element's values.

`Example record with ";" as separators - arrow:305 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/arrow%3A305/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <tableOfContents>Library Fund Honors Marian; Noted Craftsman Lauds Arrowmont; Gatlinburg Residents Enjoy Craft Courses;
    Tennessee Gammas Honor Prof. Heard</tableOfContents>

`Example record with "-" as separators - agrtfhs:2119 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/agrtfhs%3A2119/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <tableOfContents>Snap beans: machine vs. hand harvest - New bulletins - Protein with high silage rations -- dairy
     - Pepper yields and fertility, plant spacing - Stripping vs. spindle picking of 4 cottons - Personnel changes -
     Soybean irrigation - Alfalfa crown rot - Bedding for better cotton stands - Controlling bagworms -
     Nitrogen on shade trees</tableOfContents>

`Example record with " -- " as separators - vanvactor:15772 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/vanvactor%3A15772/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    Catalog of books, scores, and manuscripts in Special Collections -- Books and scores in the George F. DeVine Music
    Library -- Sound recordings, 1942-1979</tableOfContents>

All values within :code:`tableOfContents` will be mapped to RDF in the same way. Below is a representation of arrow:305.

Leverage Marc Relators for Name RDF Property and Relationship to the Digital Object
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

A :code:`name/namePart` value shares the name of an individual who is related to the digital object. All instances of :code:`name`
have a :code:`role/roleTerm` that can be leveraged to determine the name's particular relationship to the object. In some cases,
there is a :code:`roleTerm/@valueURI`, but this is not always the case.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Names are important access points for users. The relator terms are also essential to retain because they indicate how a
name is relevant to the object.

XPaths
^^^^^^

:code:`name/namePart` OR

:code:`name[@valueURI!=""]`

Decisions
^^^^^^^^^

For all instances of :code:`name`, leverage the marcrelator value found in its :code:`role/roleTerm` for
associating the name with the digital object.

A lookup table is included as an appendix to help with this.

If the :code:`name` has a :code:`valueURI` attribute, use it for the object of the triple.  If it does not, use
the text value of :code:`name/namePart`.

When you have a :code:`name` with a :code:`valueURI` attribute like `tdh:8803 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/tdh%3A8803/datastream/MODS/>`_:

.. code-block:: xml

    <name valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2017180154">
        <namePart>White, Hugh Lawson, 1773-1840</namePart>
        <role>
            <roleTerm authority="marcrelator" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/crp">
                Correspondent
            </roleTerm>
        </role>
    </name>

Leverage the :code:`@valueURI` and make it the object of the triple:

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:crp <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n2017180154> .

When there is no :code:`name/@valueURI`, use the string literal from :code:`name/namePart`. `cDanielCartoon:1000 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/cDanielCartoon%3A1000/datastream/MODS/view>`_
is an example record containing a :code:`name` value missing a :code:`@valueURI`:

.. code-block:: xml

    <name type="personal">
        <namePart>Daniel, Charles R. (Charlie), Jr., 1930-</namePart>
        <role>
            <roleTerm type="text" authority="marcrelator" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm>
        </role>
    </name>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:cre "Daniel, Charles R. (Charlie), Jr., 1930-" .

If there is a :code:`name/@valueURI` but it's empty, use the string literal instead. '`volvoices:2495 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:2495/datastream/MODS>`_
is an example of this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <name authority="naf" type="corporate" valueURI="">
        <namePart>Bemis Bro. Bag Company</namePart>
        <role>
            <roleTerm authority="marcrelator" type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/asn">Associated name</roleTerm>
        </role>
    </name>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:asn "Bemis Bro. Bag Company" .

Names with Multiple Role Terms
------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, a :code:`name` will have multiple roles.  For instance, a person might be both the "Copyright holder" and
the "Photographer".

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to not lose any information, it is essential that all the relationships between people and our digital object are kept.
This means that the same :code:`namePart` value may be present more than once to account for the variety of ways in which
it may be related to the object being described.

XPaths
^^^^^^

:code:`count(name/role)>1`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - harp:1 MODS record <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/harp%3A1/datastream/MODS>`_:

.. code-block:: xml

    <name authority="naf" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2002022963">
        <namePart>Swan, W. H. (William H.)</namePart>
        <role>
            <roleTerm authority="marcrelator" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cmp">
                Composer
            </roleTerm>
        </role>
        <role>
            <roleTerm authority="marcrelator" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/com">
                Compiler
            </roleTerm>
        </role>
    </name>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:cmp <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2002022963> ;
        relators:com <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2002022963> .

Do Not Keep Any Other Values Associated with a Name
---------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

There are other XPaths in our system that are associated with names that are no longer needed.  Information present in these
Xpaths includes the nationality of a named individual as well as their birth and/or death dates or dates of artistic activity.
The Archivision collection includes the most added sub-elements within :code:`name`. All of those not mentioned previously
will be dropped.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In an RDF based system that leverages linked data, it's unnecessary to keep traditional :code:`name` information
like :code:`authority`, :code:`displayForm`, :code:`type`, or :code:`description`. Authorities are present in the URI itself and information such as
:code:`description` or :code:`displayForm` are available from the class our object refers to.  We recognize that :code:`type` is not available
and are willing to lose this information in the interest of making our data more manageable.

XPaths
^^^^^^

:code:`name/role/roleTerm/@authority` OR

:code:`name/@authority` OR

:code:`name/role/roleTerm/@authorityURI` OR

:code:`name/@type` OR

:code:`name/displayForm` OR

:code:`name/description`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Several of these values which will be dropped are illustrated in this `example record - archivision:1959 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/archivision%3A1959/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <name type="personal" authority="ulan" valueURI="http://vocab.getty.edu/ulan/500009663">

        <displayForm>John Henry Burgee</displayForm>
        <namePart type="date">born 1933</namePart>

originInfo/dateCreated
----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`dateCreated` captures dates and date ranges identifying or approximating when the physical object was created. Most of
UT's records currently have both a human-readable date and a machine-readable date (following the extended date time format).

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`dateCreated` values provide important access points for users and can be easily mapped to an equivalent property -
`dcterms:created`. This mapping allows :code:`dateCreated` values to remain distinct from other types of date values.

Decisions
^^^^^^^^^

We will convert `w3cdtf` to `edtf` values as part of our migration process; additionally, we will integrate EDTF Level 2 features where necessary. The `dcterms:created` property was selected.

originInfo/dateIssued
---------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`dateIssued` captures dates and date ranges identifying or approximating when the physical object was issued. Typically
"issued" is associated with the act of publication. Serials, sheet music, and other published materials will have a :code:`dateIssued`
value rather than a :code:`dateCreated` value.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`dateIssued` values provide important access points for users and can be easily mapped to an equivalent property -
`dcterms:issued`. This mapping allows :code:`dateIssued` values to remain distinct from other types of date values.

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will integrate EDTF Level 2 features where applicable. The `dcterms:issued` property was selected.

`Example record - volvoices:2993 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A2993>`_

        dcterms:issued "1948~" .

originInfo/dateOther
--------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`dateOther` captures other significant dates associated with the resource. In UT's data it is primarily present in
collections that have not been fully remediated. When UT's metadata was migrated from Dublin Core to MODS and the standard
LoC transform was applied, all dates were set to :code:`dateOther` because it was impossible to individually distinguish whether
:code:`dateIssued` or :code:`dateCreated` would be accurate.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While some of the values within :code:`dateOther` may be ultimately better assigned to :code:`dateIssued` or :code:`dateCreated`,
in migrating to a new system and RDF we can only aim to keep the accuracy we already have. Some date values, like those given
in the example below, will always be distinct from :code:`dateIssued` or :code:`dateCreated`, so a separate category is
needed.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`originInfo/dateOther` OR

:code:`originInfo/dateOther[@encoding='edtf']` OR

:code:`originInfo/dateOther[@encoding='edtf'][@point='end']` OR

:code:`originInfo/dateOther[@encoding='edtf'][@point='start']`

Decisions
^^^^^^^^^

As part of leveraging the EDTF format, some conversion will be necessary; e.g. translating date strings to EDTF values as in the following example. The `dcterms:date` property was selected.

        relators:pub <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80003889> .

originInfo/place/placeTerm
---------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath identifies a place associated with the publication or creation of the resource. Some values follow a controlled vocabulary
while others do not.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Values in :code:`place/placeTerm` share origin information that is distinct from geographic subjects that describe places
the resource is "about." For those researching publishing in particular regions, :code:`place/placeTerm` values will be
very helpful. Note that whether or not the place of publication was supplied will not be retained in migration, though
the value itself will be regardless of the presence of :code:`@supplied`.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`originInfo/place/placeTerm[@text]` OR

:code:`originInfo/place/placeTerm[@text][@valueURI]` OR

:code:`originInfo/place[@supplied]/placeTerm[@text][@valueURI]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The majority of the applicable values are associated with a :code:`@valueURI`.  The `relators:pup` property was selected.

.. code-block:: xml

    <originInfo>
        <place supplied="yes">
            <placeTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79072935">Meadville (Crawford County, Pa.)</placeTerm>
        </place>

        dcterms:created "between 1890 and 1930?", "1890?/1930" .

Empty :code:`placeTerm` elements will be ignored.

originInfo/publisher
--------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Identifies a publisher associated with the resource. Note that while many of the publishers are associated with controlled
vocabularies and have URIs, MODS 3.5 does not support :code:`@valueURI` on :code:`publisher`. Therefore only strings will
be migrated.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`publisher` values share important information about who produced a publication. It will be treated similarly to
:code:`name/namePart` values mentioned. `relators:pbl` can be used to show that the values share corporations responsible
for the publication of a resource.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`originInfo/publisher`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `relators:pbl` property was selected.
`Example record - <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/utsmc%3A13759>`_:

originInfo/issuance
-------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath provides details for how the resource was published. All 4207 of our instances of :code:`issuance` have the value "serial".
Currently this is not displayed in facets or the "Click for Details" section. These values are also not shared with DPLA.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As UT is not actively using these values for search and discovery and the element is only selectively applied to a particular
set of records, these values should be dropped.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`originInfo/issuance`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will not be migrating :code:`issuance` values. Here's an example record with this element - `agrutesc:2439 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/agrutesc%3A2439/datastream/MODS/view>`_:

digitalOrigin
-------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Currently there are 28,137 records that have a :code:`digitalOrigin` value. This value is absent from 23,190 records. While present
in the MODS record, these values (UT metadata contains "born digital", "digitized other analog", and "reformatted digital")
are not publicly displayed anywhere. These values communicate the "method by which a resource achieved digital form."

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have decided for a number of reasons that migrating our :code:`digitalOrigin` values is not beneficial. As mentioned above,
these values are not currently viewable by users. Arguably, these values will also already be apparent from the technical
metadata and do not need to be captured in the descriptive metadata. In addition, we are unaware of any backend technical
use case for this data at present. While knowing if something is "born digital" might be useful, all of the content within
Digital Collections is curated and meets our technical expectations. A "born digital" label would be more actionable for
resources gathered outside of the Digital Collections creation process. These born digital resources from "the wild" would
likely not be on the same platform as Digital Collections resources.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/digitalOrigin`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We have decided to not migrate these values as is justified above. Here's an `example record - voloh:10 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/voloh%3A10/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <digitalOrigin>born digital</digitalOrigin>

note
----

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Two collections, the Botanical Photography of Alan S. Heilman and the William Derris Film Collection, include :code:`note` elements
within :code:`physicalDescription`. These values are of two types. The majority of the values communicate camera settings for the
Heilman collection, while a smaller number of values share the "Film type" that was used to produce the print that was
digitized. Below is a small sample of these values:

1. Camera setting: 7@50 on 25; with filter
2. 0.18x magnification, 100 Velvia
3. Film type: Kodachrome Transparency
4. zoomA -> 70 [A], Auto f16E100s
5. Film type: GEMounts

These values are somewhat problematic because they do not describe the digitized resource, but instead provide information about
the process that created these resources. This is useful information to know, but it is not tied directly to the resource, making
the inclusion of the values within :code:`physicalDescription` inaccurate.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since UT does not use :code:`physicalDescription/note` regularly, it would streamline the data if these values could be
appropriately placed elsewhere. An attempt was made to match film type values ("GEMounts" and "Kodachrome Transparency") with AAT
terms, but it was not possible to find anything appropriate for "GEMounts." The accuracy of some of this information is questionable
(for instance, GEMounts are likely a brand instead of a film type), but without access to the actual materials during the quarantine, it is
impossible to make an informed judgement on what should be changed. To retain this contextual information that might
prove useful to researchers interested in photographic processes and techniques, it seems best to simply put these values
in a generic `note` field. If additional attention can be given to these two collections in the future, we can remediate
the metadata following migration with the benefit of having access to the physical materials.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/note`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

All values will be moved to a generic note field.

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        skos:note "Film type: GEMounts", "Camera setting: 10@50 at 4ft" .

extent
------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The :code:`extent` element includes values that indicate time and physical dimensions. Time is consistently shared in hours, minutes
and seconds. Physical dimensions are most consistently represented in inches and feet, but cm are also used for smaller
items that might benefit from a more granular measurement.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While this kind of information has historically been included in MARC records to ensure that books are not larger than
the shelf height, extent values can also provide important contextual information that is relevant to better understanding
resources in a digital environment. Particularly in the case of photography, the dimensions can be used to help determine
the type of film.

The working group's shared philosophies were influential in decided on the best property to use for :code:`extent` values. The
Islandora Metadata Interest Group's default mapping suggests using `dcterms:extent` and using a blank node with a literal as
a RDF value. This group is against using blank nodes when at all possible because they make it more difficult for the
user to consume content. The Samvera mapping uses `rdau:P60550`, which is less than ideal because `rdau` does not support
content negotiation. This means that the URI provided for the desired property does not allow a user to directly request
RDF. No other more suitable properties could be found for :code:`extent` values. Given this predicament, the working group
decided to use `rdau:P60550` because it is dereferenceable, which a blank node is not. Still, the inability to retrieve
RDF directly will limit users wishing to interact with our data in this way.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/extent`

Decision
^^^^^^^^
`Example record - knoxgardens:125 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/knoxgardens%3A125/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        rdau:P60550 "3 1/4 x 5 inches" .

extent - @unit
--------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The Great Smoky Mountains Colloquy collection is the only collection that includes :code:`@unit` on :code:`extent`. The
collection consists of 34 total records. This is another case where increased granularity was possible through MODS, but
it has not been found to be helpful in sharing UT's metadata more effectively. The established practice is to share the
unit along with the measurement in a single string.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important for the user to know what the unit of measurement is for a value within the :code:`extent` field. It is also
important for us to share this information consistently. In order to retain the needed information while also conforming
the metadata from this collection with the rest of our records, we propose that the :code:`@unit` value is added to the :code:`extent`
string during migration. This would involve simply taking the existing value in :code:`extent` and then adding ' pages' to the
string. Note that all of the resources within the Colloquy collection have more than one page, so the plural form of the
word will always be accurate. See the Decision section of extent above for more explanation of `rdau:P60550`.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/extent[@unit="pages"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - colloquy:202 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/colloquy%3A202/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <extent unit="pages">4</extent>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix rdau: <http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        rdau:P60550 "4 pages" .

form - No URI
-------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

At the time of analysis, there were 10,853 records that contained a :code:`form` term without an associated :code:`@valueURI`.
Presently :code:`form` values are displayed in facets and within the "Click for details" section (regardless of whether
they follow an authority or not).


Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Form values are important access points that provide more specific information than is provided in higher-level elements
like :code:`typeOfResource`. Through individually assessing the values, it was determined that all of these values come from the
Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), but without additional remediation the relationship of these values to the controlled
vocabulary is not actionable. In the coming months, work will be done to add the appropriate valueURIs to these records,
but we want to make sure that this work is not a blocker to migration. In order to leverage the capabilities of Linked
Data, we plan to remediate as many of these records as possible while choosing a mapping that allows flexibility in the
value type. Anything values that are not remediated to include URIs before migration can be addressed via SPARQL queries
afterwards.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/form`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will use `edm:hasType` instead of `dcterms:format` in order to accommodate form values without a URI. We need to move all
of the form values over, so using `edm:hasType` will make sure that we bring every form term regardless of whether it is
defined as a URI or a literal.

Here's an `example record - gamble:1 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gamble%3A1/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <form>cartoons (humorous images)</form>

    @prefix edm: <http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        edm:hasType "cartoons (humorous images)" .

form - Has URI
--------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The majority of UT's :code:`form` values include a :code:`valueURI` from the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). :code:`form`
values are not currently displayed in DPLA's interface, but `DPLA's MAP 5 <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJEWhnYy5Ch7_ef_-V48-FAViA72OieG/view>`_
lists preferred from subtype values that will eventually be implemented. Work has been done to align as many of our :code:`form`
terms as possible with this preferred list.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`form` values are important access points that provide more specific information than is provided in higher-level elements
like :code:`typeOfResource`.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/form[@valueURI]`

form - @type="material"
-----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The Archivision collection has a special :code:`type` attribute so that the list of materials used to create specific buildings
can be faceted. The material types are consistently listed in the same order within the string to make this possible.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to attempt to streamline this data to better align with UT's existing records, all existing terms were compared
with similar terms from the Art and Architecture Thesaurus. The hope was to split the string field on commas and find
controlled terms for each individual value so that these could simply be presented in :code:`physicalDescription/form`
without the need for a unique :code:`type` attribute. Analysis showed that a number of values included very specific descriptions
of the material type in parentheses following the broader term. For instance, 'marble (white Carrara and green Prato marble).'
This specificity made it impossible to use the AAT without losing some of the information present in the original records.
Treating these values as part of the abstract will ensure that they display prominently, which would not be the case with
a note value necessarily. To make this read more fluidly, 'Made of ' can be added to the front of the string and an ending
period added ('.').

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/form[@type="material"]`

^^^^^^^^

internetMediaType
-----------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

A total of 14,725 records have an :code:`internetMediaType` while this element is not present in 36,602 records. It is used to indicate
the MIME type of the access file for the digitized resource. It is displayed in the "Click for Details" section.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This information within the descriptive metadata should not be migrated as it will be captured automatically during
file characterization in the new system. In addition, many of the current values over from the existing metadata are
inaccurate and therefore should not be shared.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`physicalDescription/internetMediaType`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

note - Just a note
------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`note` values contain a great variety of information in an unstructured string form. Currently they are displayed
in the brief results in Islandora as well as within the "Click for Details" section. Unlike :code:`abstract`, :code:`note`
values often share supplemental information rather than a summary of the resource's aboutness. Information shared includes
donor information, transcriptions of written content, contact information, and suggested citation formats.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of their unstructured nature, usually a :code:`note` is just a :code:`note`. It is not essential that all different
types of notes are distinct from one another. UT's MODS current contains more granularity than it is essential to retain,
as is apparent from the variety of :code:`@type` values present in the Xpath section below. While these different types of
notes have unique Xpaths, nothing is currently being done beyond the XML to make these distinctions apparent to users.
Therefore unique properties do not need to be identified for each type of note.

The Samvera community attempts to keep some of the granularity of MODS by prepending the text value of the attribute
to the text node when one exists.  UT has decided to follow this general approach. When :code:`@type` does not exist, simply take
the text node.

In BIBFRAME, there was no attempt to convert the 562 MARC field.  For this reason, "handwritten" documents are just
regular notes.

XPath
^^^^^

When the XPath has a specific attribute and value, prepend the value to the text node.

:code:`note` OR

:code:`note[@type="handwritten"]` OR

:code:`note[@displayLabel="Attribution"]` OR

:code:`note[@displayLabel="use and reproduction"]` OR

:code:`note[@displayLabel="Local Rights"]`

note - Instrumentation
----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`@type="Instrumentation"` is used in the Van Vactor Music collection as a listing of the performing forces called for by
a particular piece of music. While only used for a single collection at this point, the intention is to use it for any future
records for music resources involving more than simply voice and piano. `Documentation <https://jirautk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLP/pages/3047434>`_ was created to share what UT considers
"score order", as there is some variation on the order in which instruments should be listed. Having established what
UT considers "score order", it is possible to use :code:`note[@type="Instrumentation"]` as a facet in addition to showing
the string value in the "Click for Details" section.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of the desire to be able to facet on instrumentation, a separate property is needed to distinguish it from other
note values. We reviewed several bibliographic and music ontologies including the Music Ontology, the Internet of Music Thingz, and
MusicBrainz, but none seemed to have a predicate to represent this idea. We did notice that Opaque Namespace by
Oregon Digital did have a matching predicate.  In the Samvera community, not only is this ontology used, but occasionally
the community has suggested new predicates to be created within Opaque Namespaces.

XPath

note - First Line
-----------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

When a note has a :code:`@type = "First line"` or :code:`@type = "first line"`, it is not a general note. Instead, this element is
a direct transcription of the first line of lyrics appearing in a song.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We reviewed several bibliographic and music ontologies including the Music Ontology, the Internet of Music Thingz, and
MusicBrainz, but none seemed to have a predicate to represent this idea. We did notice that Opaque Namespace by

note - Target audience
----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

A note with :code:`@displayLabel` with the value of "Grade level" refers to the target audience of the resource. This Xpath
is present solely within the Arrowmont Curriculum documents, but could be used more broadly for other resources with an
educational focus.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MARC 521 field should be mapped to the BIBFRAME intended audience field. The field is defined as information that
identifies the specific audience or intellectual level for which the content of the resource is considered appropriate.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`note[@displayLabel="Grade level"]`

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Some of our :code:`note`\ s actually refer to uncontrolled keywords or tags.

None type
---------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Several :code:`subject` elements contain unintentional null values. There are five within Tennessee Documentary History. Additional null
:code:`subject`\ s include vpmoore:133 and adams:76. Most of roth seems to have null :code:`subject/name/namePart` values.
It appears we might have inserted some blank nodes using the Islandora form entry. As there is no information, these
"values" are not used and have no true use case.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These nodes contain no information.

XPath
^^^^^

    :code:`subject/topic[string() = '']` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string() = '']` OR

    :code:`subject/name/namePart[string() = '']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

Topical and name subjects with URIs
-----------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Remediated collections include :code:`subject` values with URIs.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In migration, :code:`subject`\ s with :code:`name` and :code:`topic` values will be treated in the same way. We have decided that the previous
distinction between :code:`name` and :code:`topic` values as :code:`subject`\ s is not essential - only the presence of all the values in the
metadata is important.

XPath
^^^^^

Note that there is inconsistency in where the :code:`valueURI` attribute is placed.

    :code:`subject[@valueURI]/topic` OR

    :code:`subject/topic[@valueURI]` OR

    :code:`subject[@valueURI]/name/namePart` OR

    :code:`subject/name[@valueURI]/namePart`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

When a :code:`valueURI` is present for :code:`topic` or :code:`name` subject, it will be the value used in migration. Examples showing each
of the distinct XPaths are given below:

        dcterms:subject <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n87116131> .

Name and topical subjects without URIs
--------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

UT will need to treat any of these :code:`subject`\ s that are not able to be reconciled as string values. For the postcard collection,
the use of dots (Database of the Smokies) as the authority makes it impossible to include a URI presently. Other collections
with string values are the Charlie Daniel Cartoon Collection, Ed Gamble Cartoon Collection, Football Programs, Insurance Company of
North America Records, American Civil War Collection, Ramsey Family Papers, Tennessee Documentary History,
and Volunteer Voices.

The Volunteer Voices collection includes :code:`subject`\ s with three different :code:`displayLabel` values - "Volunteer Voices Curriculum Topics",
"Tennessee Social Studies K-12 Eras in American History", and "Broad Topics". These :code:`subject`\ s are currently given separate
facets in Islandora's metadata display. Discovery to the collection via two of these subject categories is also featured
on the `Tennessee State Library and Archives website <https://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/volunteer-voices>`_ ("Broad Topics"
and "Tennessee Social Studies K-12 Eras in American History"). While these :code:`subject`\ s have been distinguished previously from
other :code:`subject`\ s in the past by their distinct XPath, having so many different types of :code:`subject`\ s was found to be unnecessary
going forward. "Broad Topics" and "Curriculum Topics" will be folded in with all other :code:`subject`\ s. For links to external websites,
like TSLA's, we can use the string values to supply a link without needing to place them in a separate property. Note that
:code:`subject`\ s associated with "Tennessee Social Studies K-12 Eras in American History" are dealt with
separately below.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`subject` values are important access points for users that require migration. While URIs would be ideal from a technical
standpoint, strings still support discovery.

XPath
^^^^^

    :code:`mods/subject[not(@valueURI)]/topic[not(@valueURI)]` OR

    :code:`mods/subject[not(@valueURI)]/name[not(valueURI)]/namePart[not(valueURI)]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

String values for :code:`topic` or :code:`name` subjects will be migrated when a :code:`valueURI` is not present.

Here's an `example record where only string values are available for topical subjects - gamble:123 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gamble%3A123/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:subject "Civil Rights movement in Tennessee" .

Temporal subjects
-----------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`subject/temporal` values share information about a time period using text or a date (:code:`edtf`). None of our existing :code:`subject/temporal`
values include URIs. These values are prominent in Volunteer Voices and the Pi Beta Phi to Arrowmont collections. While not from established controlled
vocabularies like LCHS, :code:`subject/temporal` values are present in facets as the strings are often constructed consistently.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`subject/temporal` values provide important access points. While not associated with a URI, the values are often from controlled
vocabularies created as part of a grant project. Because they are associated with grants and cross-institutional projects,
retaining these values is particularly important.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`mods/subject/temporal`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

:code:`temporal` :code:`subject`\ s without the :code:`displayLabel` attribute will be directly mapped as strings to `schema:temporalCoverage`. This
property was chosen because it allows a wider range of values than other potential solutions (such as `dcterms:temporalCoverage`
which requires that the value is part of the class PeriodOfTime).

`Example of temporal subject - arrow:268 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/arrow%3A268>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <subject>
        <temporal>The Birth of Arrowmont, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, 1965-1979</temporal>
    </subject>


.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> schema:temporalCoverage "The Birth of Arrowmont, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, 1965-1979" .

In addition to these textual values, UT does have :code:`temporal` :code:`subject`\ s that share numeric dates in EDTF format. These are
primarily from the Volunteer Voices collection. `Here's an example record - volvoices:2945 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A2945/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <subject>
        <temporal>1970-09-30</temporal>
    </subject>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> schema:temporalCoverage "1970-09-30" .

Temporal subjects from Volunteer Voices (K-12 Eras) with string and XPath inconsistencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

While two of the subject categories associated with the Volunteer Voices collection can be folded into `dcterms:subject`
directly ("Broad Topics" and "Volunteer Voices Curriculum Topics"), special attention needs to be given to :code:`subject`\ s associated
with "Tennessee Social Studies K-12 Eras in American History". There are instances in which a value associated with one
of these topics is used, but the :code:`displayLabel` has been left off and they have incorrectly been categorized as :code:`geographic`
:code:`subject`\ s.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important to treat these values as a separate category to ensure that the text value is not split across separate
categories (aka `schema:temporalCoverage` and `dcterms:subject`). In addition, some standardization of the label needs to be
done for all the records associated with a given concept to be colocated.

XPath
^^^^^

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="Contemporary United States (1968-present)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="Postwar United States (1945-1970)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="The Great Depression and World War II (1929-1945)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="The Emergence of Modern America (1890-1930)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="The Development of the Industrial United States (1870-1900)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="Expansion and Reform (1801-1861)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="Revolution and the New Nation (1754-1820)."]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[string()="Colonization and Settlement (1585-1763)."]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

An `example of a record that leaves off the displayLabel, but the string matches a K-12 era - volvoices:11303  <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11303/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <subject>
        <geographic>Expansion and Reform (1801-1861).</geographic>
    </subject>

The final :code:`subject/geographic` value actually matches one of the values listed in the "Tennessee Social Studies K-12 Eras
in American History". While it is placed in a :code:`geographic` :code:`subject` here in the XML, it should be in a :code:`temporal` :code:`subject` (as
the date range following the text suggests). One value is placed in :code:`subject/topic`. The following values are all
of the exceptions:

We will want to remediate before migration, match on and transform these values during migration, or deal with them after migration. The string values
also don't exactly match the string values present in :code:`topic[@displayLabel="Tennessee Social Studies K-12 Eras in American History"]`.
The eras ("Era 2 - ", "Era 3 - ", etc.) need to be added and the trailing periods removed for these to match. Below is a

Geographic subjects
-------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

UT has :code:`subject/geographic` values associated with and without URIs. Like with other elements, the placement of the URIs is not consistent.
URIs will be used when present, but strings can be used when there is no URI.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`subject/geographic` values warrant a separate property from both :code:`subject/temporal` and :code:`subject/topic` so that they can be displayed
separately on the interface.

XPath
^^^^^

    :code:`subject[@valueURI]/geographic` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[@valueURI]`

As noted previously, there are a handful of string values in :code:`geographic` elements within volvoices that need to be moved
to be treated differently than other :code:`geographic` values.

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="Contemporary United States (1968-present).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="Postwar United States (1945-1970).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="The Great Depression and World War II (1929-1945).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="The Emergence of Modern America (1890-1930).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="The Development of the Industrial United States (1870-1900).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="Expansion and Reform (1801-1861).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="Revolution and the New Nation (1754-1820).")]` OR

    :code:`subject/geographic[not(string()="Colonization and Settlement (1585-1763).")]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Here's an example where the URI is present on the subject - webster:1127 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/webster%3A1127/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

        <geographic>Great Smoky Mountains (N.C. and Tenn.)</geographic>
    </subject>

`Here's an example where the URI is present on the geographic element - roth:2165 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/roth%3A2165/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <subject>
        <geographic authority="geonames" valueURI="http://sws.geonames.org/4178924/about.rdf">Yulee Sugar Mill Ruins Historic State Park</geographic>
    </subject>

Regardless of URI placement, we will map the values the same. Note that if the :code:`geographic` term includes coordinates and
a :code:`geonames` URI, we will drop the coordinates. More information on this is given in the Coordinates section following this
section. Below is the decision for webster:1127.

.. code-block:: turtle

        dcterms:spatial <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85057008> .

If only strings are present, like with `volvoices:14173 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A14173/datastream/MODS/view>`_, then the string value will be kept.

Coordinates
-----------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

There are a total of **702 unique coordinate values** in UT's collections. Many are associated with geonames terms,
but there are 8 coordinates associated with Library of Congress terms. These terms are "Great Smoky Mountains
National Park (N.C. And Tenn.)", "Knoxville (Tenn.)", "Sevier County (Tenn.)", "Dickson County (Tenn.)", "Hardin County (Tenn.)",
"Bluff City (Tenn.)", and "Saint Andrews (Tenn.)". In addition, there are **120 geographic names that are not associated**
**with an authority** through the use of a URI, but they contain coordinates. The following lists some: "Abrams Creek", "Anthony Creek (Tenn.)",
"Arcadia Dam (Okla.)", "Arch Rock", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "Becky Cable House (Tenn.)", "Boston (Mass.)", "Bote Mountain Trail (Tenn.)",
"Bristol (Tenn.)", "Cades Cove Campground (Tenn.)", "Cades Cove Loop Road (Tenn.)", "Cades Cove Picnic Area (Tenn.)",
"Calderwood Dam (Tenn.)", "California", "Chattanooga (Tenn.)", "Cherokee Orchard (Tenn.)", "Chestnut Flats", "Chilhowee (Extinct city)",
"Chimney Tops", "Chimney Tops (Tenn.)", "Chimney Tops Foot Bridge (Tenn.)", "Chimney Tops Trail", "Clingmans Dome Road",
"Davenport Gap (Tenn.)", "Deals Gap (Tenn.)", "Dry Sluice Gap (Tenn.)", "Dry Valley (Tenn.)", "Elijah Oliver Place (Tenn.)",
"Fighting Creek Gap (Tenn.)", "Florida", "Fontana Dam (N.C.)", "Foothills Parkway", "Forge Creek", "Forney Ridge Parking Lot (N.C.)",
"Fort George Site", "Fort Manuel Site", "Fowler (Kan.)", "Gatlinburg (Tenn.)", "Greenbrier Pinnacle (Tenn.)", "Gregory Bald (Tenn.)",
"Guyot, Mount (Tenn.)", "Harrison, Mount (Tenn.)", "Headrick Chapel (Tenn.)", and many more.

For those :code:`geographic` names associated with :code:`geonames` through a URI, there is arguably no need to migrate the coordinates
as a string value as these can be retrieved using the URI at any time.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having :code:`coordinates` to leverage support mapping and digital humanities projects. :code:`coordinates` increase the number of
ways in which our data can be used.

XPath
^^^^^

    :code:`subject/cartographics/coordinates`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Here's an example record - webster:1005 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/webster%3A1005/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <subject authority="geonames" valueURI="https://sws.geonames.org/4630912">

            <coordinates>36.11175, -83.76657</coordinates>

All that is needed in this case is to bring over the URI.

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:spatial <https://sws.geonames.org/4630912> .

Given the extent of :code:`coordinates` that cannot be retrieved using a URI (120), a separate solution is needed to preserve these values.

        dcterms:spatial "35.58546, -83.84444" .

Name values with roleTerms represented as subjects
--------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The Arrowmont Simple Images collection include :code:`subject/name/namePart` values with a :code:`roleTerm`. Something should
be treated as a :code:`subject` if it is represented within a photograph and treated as a name with a :code:`roleTerm` if the individual
listed is associated with the creation or provenance of the item depicted. As the :code:`name` values are currently represented
in the metadata, these two distinct categories are mixed. The only place where the two can overlap is if the name
is given a role of `"Depicted" - <https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/dpc>`_.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the :code:`name`\ s are currently represented, they share incorrect information.

XPath
^^^^^

    :code:`mods/subject/name[role]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

`Example record - arrsimple:344 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/arrsimple%3A344/datastream/MODS/view>`_
This record is particularly problematic because it both suggests that Aunt Lydia Whaley is the photographer and that the
photographer is unknown. This suggests that she cannot have the role of photographer. She may be depicted within the
photograph, but this is also unconfirmed. While more vague, the safest way to deal with these records is to drop the
:code:`roleTerm` and treat the :code:`name` values as general subjects. For this record, the inclusion of this :code:`subject` could mean that
Aunt Lydia is the woman depicted, but it could also reinforce the title (Aunt Lydia's cave by the creek). It is
ambiguous, but doesn't state anything that is clearly untrue.

.. code-block:: xml

    <subject authority="local">
        <name>

genre: values that map to dcterms:type
--------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`genre`, without any attributes, has been used as a catch-all descriptive element that may or may not hold values from a controlled vocabulary, and that may or may not provide appropriate descriptive information about the resource. :code:`genre[@authority='dct']` has three distinct values: "text", "still image", and "image", that broadly indicate the type of the resource being described. This category consists of :code:`typeOfResource` values that are present in :code:`genre` due to the use of the LoC Dublin Core to MODS transform. In many remediated collections, these values have already been moved to :code:`typeOfResource`, but there are still many that remain in :code:`genre` that should be addressed for consistency's sake during migration.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The justification for keeping :code:`genre` values that map to `dcterms:type`, is the same as the justification for keeping :code:`typeOfResource` values generally.
Values within :code:`typeOfResource` are used for initial faceting in search for both UT's local Digital Collections website
and for DPLA's interface. As DPLA doesn't display :code:`physicalDescription/form` values, it is important to share this
less granular indication of the resource type.

For values *outside* of the following table, we selected the `edm:hasType` property as it aligns well with the possible overlap between :code:`genre` and :code:`physicalDescription/form`. To help prevent duplicating string literals and URIs, the following table suggests a mapping for a limited subset of the union of values in :code:`genre[not(@*)]` and :code:`genre[@authority='dct']`.

genre values that map to edm:hasType
------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`genre[not(@*)]` has been used a catch-all descriptive element that may or may not hold values from a controlled vocabulary, and that may or may not provide appropriate descriptive information about the resource. Unlike the previous category, values within :code:`genre[not(@*)]` generally contain more specific terms related to the physical characteristics of a resource and closely mirror MODS :code:`physicalDescription/form` values.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The justification for keeping these values is similar to that expressed for :code:`physicalDescription/form` values that do not
have a :code:`@valueURI`. This category contains terms that should be in :code:`physicalDescription/form` if more time for
remediation had been possible.

The values in this XPath fall outside of the table presented in the preceding section ("genre values that map to dcterms:type").

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`genre[not(@*) and not(string() = ('cartographic','notated music'))]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Use the `edm:hasType` property for these values.

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix edm: <http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> edm:hasType "Hogsheads" .

genre[@authority='aat']
-----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`genre[@authority='aat']` appears in the Archivision collection and uses a controlled vocabulary. Generally these
terms reflect an artistic style or period. While some values potentially mirror MODS :code:`subject/temporal` values, in
many cases the building described was built after the period mentioned, but still in that time period's style. Therefore
the terms relate more closely to a general :code:`subject/topic` rather than :code:`subject/temporal`.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These values share important information about architectural style that could help users search through Archivision more effectively.

These will be treated as `dcterms:subject`, based on the values from the AAT controlled vocabulary. `edm:hasType`, which is
suggested by Samvera as the best match for :code:`genre` is not used in order to keep values from :code:`genre` and :code:`physicalDescription/form`
separate following migration.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`genre[@authority='aat']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `dcterms:subject` property was selected.

genre[@authority='lcsh']
------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Used in the Archivision, Charlie Daniels, and AirScoop collections. There are four distinct values in the XPath:
"Editorial cartoons", "College student newspapers and periodicals", "Twentieth century", and "Nineteenth century".

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As these values come directly from the Library of Congress Subject Headings (lcsh), they would benefit from being grouped with
all of the other values from this vocabulary in `dcterms:subject`. They share helpful information about a resource's subject
matter rather than a style.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`genre[@authority='lcsh']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `dcterms:subject` property was selected.

genre[@authority='lcgft']
-------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This :code:`genre` element is used in the Arrowmont, Van Vactor, VP Moore, and Kefauver Crime Documents collections. Values
within :code:`genre[@authority='lcgft']` come from the Library of Congress Genre Form Terms vocabulary and share terms
that relate to both the resource's form and subject matter (aka, the term "Newsletter" suggests certain formal characteristics,
but it also shares what type of content is present in the resource).

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because most values relate more closely to the resource's formal characteristics, `edm:hasType` was chosen for mapping.
This groups them with MODS values from :code:`physicalDescription/form`. These values are helpful to discovery and
in understanding the type of resource being viewed.

XPath
^^^^^

genre[@authority='lcmpt']
-------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath is used in the Van Vactor collection to express performance medium and instrumentation information. Individual
instruments with :code:`@valueURI` values were placed within :code:`genre[@authority='lcmpt']` based on recommendations
from the Music Library Association because a :code:`note` element could not accommodate a :code:`@valueURI`.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While all of the instruments in Van Vactor are also documented in an instrumentation note, :code:`genre[@authority='lcmpt']`
is the only place where the :code:`@valueURI` values for each instrument are present. This allows users to single out particular
instruments in their search, rather than relying on the note string that lists all instruments needed for a piece.

item has one language
---------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Single instance of :code:`languageTerm` where item language is known. Many of our resources will have one instance of a
:code:`language` element with a single subelement of :code:`languageTerm`. The :code`type` attribute for :code:`languageTerm` may be either
"text" or "code".

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both Samvera and Islandora handle this case similarly, directly mapping the URI, however, Islandora does offer an
alternative with additional minting of objects required. We will opt to go with the cleanest possible route of direct
mapping to the controlled vocabulary, ISO 639-2, and avoid minting new objects.

XPath

"No linguistic content" cases can be found across some of our resources. In these cases, a :code:`code` attribute is present with a "zxx"
value or :code:`type` attribute with a *text* value, and the :code:`languageTerm` element has a value of "No linguistic content". Justifications from the single :code:`language` case above also apply here. These are handled just like other languages in ISO 639-2 Collection of Bibliographic Codes. In this case, the "zxx" code denotes a declared absence of linguistic information.

item has multiple languages
---------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Multiple instances of a :code:`languageTerm` present. In very few cases (13 total), multiple :code:`language`\ s can be found for an item.
In all cases, :code:`language`\ s are assigned a known authority, with the :code:`type` attribute's value as "text: or "code".

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to items with one :code:`language`, URIs are directly mapped in the Samvera recommendations. Islandora does not have
recommendations for this use case. We could separate :code:`language`\ s onto new lines with a duplicate predicate. However,
as style choice and to simplify in mapped turtle, multiple :code:`language`\ s in our items will be delineated by a comma.
Justifications from the single :code:`language` case also apply here.

typeOfResource with no attributes
---------------------------------

Use case
^^^^^^^^

Most records currently have a :code:`typeOfResource` value with no attributes. Depending on the item being described, it is possible
for there to be multiple :code:`typeOfResource` values in a single record. The Islandora Metadata Interest Group has carefully
created a mapping to translate MODS :code:`typeOfResource` values to `dcterms` resource types. A selection of the mapping is
included below that addresses all of the values UT has within its metadata. Note that the final row, collection="yes"
is addressed in a subsequent category.

+----------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+--------------------+

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Values within :code:`typeOfResource` are used for initial faceting in search for both UT's local Digital Collections website
and for DPLA's interface. As DPLA doesn't display :code:`physicalDescription/form` values, it is important to share this
less granular indication of the resource type.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`typeOfResource`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Here's an `example record - vanvactor:1 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/vanvactor%3A1/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <typeOfResource collection="yes">notated music</typeOfResource>

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:type <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/not> .

typeOfResource with @collection="yes"
-------------------------------------

Use case
^^^^^^^^

In MODS, an attribute can be used on :code:`typeOfResource` to indicate that the record refers to an entire collection rather
than an individual resource. This is useful because it makes it possible to distinguish between object and collection
records in the catalog so that patrons understand more quickly how much content is associated with the record. The
Islandora Metadata Interest Group has come up with the solution of using the `dcterms` resource type of "Collection." In
this situation we will need multiple triples to preserve the information currently present - one for indicating the record is
for a collection and one (or more) for indicating prevalent resource type(s) in the collection. In MODS :code:`typeOfResource` is
a repeatable field. Note that we will need to make sure that we do not repeat the :code:`collection` resource type in cases
where there are multiple :code:`typeOfResource[@collection="yes"]` instances.

+----------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
| collection="yes"           | dcterms:type  | <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/col> | Collection         |
+----------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+--------------------+

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to be able to distinguish between an item and collection resource, so retaining this information is necessary.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`typeOfResource[@collection="yes"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Here's a complex example that includes two :code:`typeOfResource` values - `gsmrc:smhc <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gsmrc%3Asmhc/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <typeOfResource collection="yes">text</typeOfResource>
    <typeOfResource collection="yes">still image</typeOfResource>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:type <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/col> ;
        dcterms:type <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/txt> ;
        dcterms:type <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/img> .

Missing typeOfResource value
----------------------------

Use case
^^^^^^^^

Currently 9,993 records are missing a :code:`typeOfResource` value. The affected collections include Volunteer Voices (not entire
collection), Roth, the Howard Baker Speeches and Remarks, Great Smoky Mountains Colloquy, and the Great Smoky Mountains Postcard Collection. We can consider if we would like to apply a blanket value to a collection at the time of migration. For monolithic collections like Roth and Baker, this would be easy to achieve (`roth = "still image"` and `baker = "text"` in MODS). For collections with varied formats, like Volunteer Voices, this will not be possible.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given that the Digital Collections home page currently uses :code:`typeOfResource` to initially limit searches, it would be
beneficial for this value to be more consistently present. It would also assist with discovery in DPLA.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`not(typeOfResource)`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

During or post migration we will plan to add :code:`typeOfResource` on a collection basis if possible. See the chart below for decisions.

| classSchemes:lcc | Literal    | Use for values from Library of Congress Classification. |
+------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

Use case
--------

Some of our resources have already been formally cataloged and have a :code:`classification` number. When these are available,
they are included in the MODS metadata. Serials like the Alumnus and many of the Athletics media guides are good examples.
Some collections, like the University of Tennessee Commencements collection include full :code:`shelfLocator`\ s in the :code:`classification`
field (e.g. LD5297 .U55 2013). These should be edited before migration.

Justification
-------------

This information is helpful to include as it provides information about where the physical item is shelved (though this
is not a complete :code:`shelfLocator`) and the broad subject the materials relate to.

XPath
-----

:code:`classification[@authority="lcc"]` OR

part
====

Use Case
--------

The MODS :code:`part` element is infrequently used to describe a portion of a larger resource. In UT's metadata, :code:`part` is used
in two collections - Great Smoky Mountains Colloquy and Sanborn Fire Insurance Map Collection.

Justification
-------------

Ultimately it was decided that this information is not important to keep because it is already present in the title field
in both instances. With the Sanborn maps there is a difference between how the :code:`part` is named - Sheet versus District-Ward,
but it was not felt strongly that any additional remediation needed to be done.

XPath
-----

:code:`part`

Decision
--------

Drop all values in :code:`part`.

relatedItem - do not migrate
----------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem`, with and without attributes, is used in a number of collections to express structural relationships. Currently, values in this XPath are displayed in both search/browse facets and the item-level metadata display. Post-migration, we will need to consider how to express these relationships in our next-gen DAMS.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These relationships will be handled/expressed by default behavior in our next-gen DAMS. In the case of :code:`relatedItem/abstract`, the values present should be handled at the collection level.

relatedItem[@type='host'][@displayLabel='Collection']
-----------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath is used to indicate the resource's archival collection.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use these values for search/browse facets, as well as item-level metadata display. Additionally, collection titles are shared with DPLA.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='host'][@displayLabel='Collection']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `dbo:collection` property was selected.

`Example record - heilman:261 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/heilman:261/datastream/MODS/view>`_

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dbo:collection "Botany Department Photographs, AR.0488" .

relatedItem[@type='series'][@displayLabel='Project']
----------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The `@type='series'` XPath indicates a resource's archival series.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We decided not to migrate to be consistent with how we are approaching other parts of metadata relating back to a resource's archival collection. We are not migrating box and folder information, so we will not migrate series information either.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='series'][@displayLabel='Project']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

`Example record - roth:1538 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/roth:1538/datastream/MODS/view>`_

relatedItem[@type='host'][@displayLabel='Bibliographic Citation']
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath only appears 1264 times in the Arrowmont Collection, specifically the Arrow of Pi Beta Phi sub-collection.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='host'][@displayLabel='Bibliographic Citation']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `dcterms:bibliographicCitation` predicate was selected for these values.

`Example record - arrow:1 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/arrow:1/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <relatedItem type="host" displayLabel="Project">

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:bibliographicCitation "The Arrow, Volume 27, Number 1" .

relatedItem[@type="otherVersion"]
---------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type="otherVersion"]` is used to indicate identifying information about another version of the resource. It appears in the Van Vactor and Arrowmont metadata; it is used, respectively, to identify an alternate version of the sheet music or the scrapbook that holds the image.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='otherVersion']/identifier` OR

:code:`relatedItem[@type='otherVersion']/location/url`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

See the following section on :code:`relatedItem/identifier[@type]`.

The XPath :code:`relatedItem[@type='otherVersion']/location/url` will not be migrated. Because it provides a link back to the hosting scrapbook, we will not be able to migrate this specific XPath. This will need to be a post-migration metadata update.

`Example record - arrpgimg:319 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/arrpgimg:319/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <relatedItem type="otherVersion">

      </location>
    </relatedItem>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dcterms:hasVersion <uri-of-source-scrapbook-in-new-system> .

relatedItem/identifier[@type = 'local']
---------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath's attribute value (:code:`local`) is used to indicate the manuscript number associated with the resource's archival collection.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While we have decided to ignore granular archival metadata (e.g. box/folder or series information), migrating a known manuscript number gives us the ability to link back to the resource's finding aid.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem/identifier[@type='local']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

:code:`@type='local'`\ 's value, if present, maps in to the `dbo:collection` property.

`Example record - heilman:26 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/heilman:261/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <relatedItem type="host" displayLabel="Collection">
      <titleInfo>
        <title>Botany Department Photographs</title>
      </titleInfo>
      <identifier type="local">AR.0488</identifier>
    </relatedItem>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1> dbo:collection "Botany Department Photographs, AR.0488" .

relatedItem/identifier[@type = 'catalog']
-----------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`@type='catalog'` is used exclusively in the Van Vactor collection to indicate the identifying number for an alternate version of the score. All of the :code:`@type='catalog'` are established in the `David Van Vactor Collection Catalog <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/vanvactor%3A15772>`_, which served as the starting point for the digital collection.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This XPath provides contextual data for users and makes it easy to compare different versions of the same work. Title information does not always make it possible to see these relationships.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem/identifier[@type='catalog']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

:code:`@type='catalog'`\ 's value, if present, will be represented by the `opaque:sheetmusic_hostItem` property.

`Example record - vanvactor:10012 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/vanvactor:10012/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

        opaque:sheetmusic_hostItem "Three songs for soprano, alto flute, English horn, and bass clarinet, M120" .

relatedItem/identifier[@type = 'pid']
-------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`@type='pid'` is used in collection-level records to indicate featured items and should not be migrated.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because these identifiers are system-specific, they will not be useful on a new platform. We will determine alternate ways of modeling featured item metadata post-migration.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem/identifier[@type='pid']`

Decision
^^^^^^^^
Do not migrate.

`Example record - collections:knoxgardens <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/collections:knoxgardens/datastream/MODS/view>_`

.. code-block:: xml

    <relatedItem displayLabel="Featured Item">

        <originInfo>
            <dateCreated>1927-1935</dateCreated>
        </originInfo>
    </relatedItem>

relatedItem/location/url
------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath is used 8516 times, but only has 33 distinct strings. This value is used to highlight the archival collection related to the resource being described. Its availability encourages users to further explore the archival collection by giving them a link to the finding aid.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The URL is kept to encourage users to explore the physical archival collections in addition to the digital collection.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem/location/url`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `dbo:isPartOf` property was selected.

`Example record - ruskin:204 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/ruskin:204/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <relatedItem displayLabel="Collection" type="host">

        dbo:collection "Ruskin Cooperative Association Collection, MS.0023" .

relatedItem/location/physicalLocation/
--------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This XPath is used once in the Charles Dabney collection. It provides an :code:`authority`, a :code:`valueURI`, and string value, in this single case, for the University of Tennessee's Special Collections.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As this is only used once in our metadata, we have decided to remediate this XPath.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='host'][@displayLabel='Collection']/location/physicalLocation`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

`Example record - collections:dabney <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/collections:dabney/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <relatedItem displayLabel="Collection" type="host">

      </location>
    </relatedItem>

relatedItem[@type='constituent']
--------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='constituent']` appears 131 times in the Bass collection. The children of :code:`relatedItem[@type='constituent']` provide descriptive information about distinct parts of the resource.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XPaths
^^^^^^

:code:`relatedItem[@type='constituent']/titleInfo/title` AND

:code:`relatedItem[@type='constituent']/name[namePart][role/roleTerm[@authority='marcrelator'][@type='text'][@valueURI]]` AND

:code:`relatedItem[@type='constituent']/name[@authority='naf'][@valueURI][namepart][role/roleTerm[@authority='marcrelator'][@type='text'][@valueURI]]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The `dcterms:tableOfContents` property was selected to capture the title information available, the `relators` namespace was chosen to capture information available in the :code:`roleTerm` elements, and `dbo:collection` property serves to identify the name of the physical archival collection.

physicalLocation as URI
-----------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Many records have :code:`valueURI` attributes set for :code:`physicalLocation`. This is inconsistent, even in our own collections.
Not all repositories have a :code:`@valueURI` established for them.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When available, we will opt to use :code:`valueURI` values as the URI value for `relators:rps`, to better qualify objects of `relators:rps`.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/physicalLocation[@valueURI]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

The :code:`valueURI` attribute :code:`location/physicalLocation` is set as object.

`Example record - egypt:79 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/egypt:79/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <location>
        <physicalLocation valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2017033007">Frank H. McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture</physicalLocation>
    </location>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:rps <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2017033007> .

physicalLocation as string (UT)
--------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

In many of our own collections, we use strings to describe :code:`physicalLocation`. We are inconsistent in the structuring of these strings, leading to many different variations for both our Libraries and Special Collections, some of these include misspellings or just different formatting:

- "The University of Tennessee Libraries, Knoxville"
- "University of Tennesse Knoxville. Libraries"
- "University of Tennessee Knoxville. Libraries"

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create better consistency and cleanliness going forward, we will isolate all instances of these strings and transcribe them to appropriate URIs for UT Libraries and Special collections.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/physicalLocation[not(@valueURI)][text()="The University of Tennessee Libraries, Knoxville" or text()="University of Tennesse Knoxville. Libraries" or text()="University of Tennessee Knoxville. Libraries"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Even when MODS only has a string present, we will map "The University of Tennessee Libraries, Knoxville" and "University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Special Collections" to relative URIs.

`Example record - fbpro:94819 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/fbpro:94819/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <location>

        relators:rps <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014027633> .

physicalLocation as string (non-UT)
------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Across our collections, there are also many cases where non-UT items do not have URIs and instead use strings.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translating these to a relative URIs would require significant effort, and the value added may be trivial at this point.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/physicalLocation[not(@valueURI)][not(text()="The University of Tennessee Libraries, Knoxville" or text()="University of Tennesse Knoxville. Libraries" or text()="University of Tennessee Knoxville. Libraries")]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

In cases that the :code:`physicalLocation` are non-UT and only a string is provided, we will only use the string literal.

.. code-block:: xml

    <location>
        <physicalLocation>Blount County Public Library</physicalLocation>
        <holdingExternal>
            <holding xsi:schemaLocation="info:ofi/fmt:xml:xsd:iso20775 http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso20775/N130_ISOholdings_v6_1.xsd">

                    <text>City: Maryville</text>
                    <text>County: Blount County</text>
                    <text>State: Tennessee</text>
                </physicalAddress>
            </holding>
        </holdingExternal>
    </location>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:rps "Blount County Public Library" .

physicalLocation with shelfLocator (UT)
----------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

In many cases, some of our collection items will have :code:`shelfLocator` information. This shares where a physical copy
of the resource is shelved. This information may not currently be accurate and can found via Special Collections’ finding aids.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because our records in MODS records may not be accurate and this information is located elsewhere, and perhaps more accurate, we will drop this information when :code:`shelfLocator` is used in conjunction with our repositories.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location[physicalLocation[text()[contains(., "University of Tennessee")]]]/shelfLocator`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will drop :code:`shelfLocator` data when present for UT Knoxville records.

`Example record - scopes:1258 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/scopes:1258/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <location>
        <physicalLocation valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014027633">University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Special Collections</physicalLocation>
        <shelfLocator>Box 5, Folder 8</shelfLocator>
    </location>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix relators: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/> .

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:rps <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2014027633> .

physicalLocation with shelfLocator (non-UT)
--------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Instances where non-UT held items have :code:`shelfLocator` information.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While, we do not not know if this :code:`shelfLocator` information is accurate, we will opt to retain it going forward as a string and map to `skos:note`. Samvera does note some possible future availability of `opaque:locationShelfLocator`, however this predicate does not exist yet.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location[physicalLocation[text()[not(contains(., "University of Tennessee"))]]]/shelfLocator`
:code:`location[physicalLocation[not(contains(.,'University of Tennessee'))] and holdingSimple/copyInformation/shelfLocator]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will retain :code:`shelfLocator` data when present for non-UT records, and transcribe this to a `skos:note`.

`Example record - volvoices:2136 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:2136/datastream/MODS/view>`_

    <https://example.org/objects/1>
        relators:rps "Cleveland State Community College" ;
        skos:note "Shelf locator: Photograph Collection 2, People" .

physicalLocation with holdingExternal
-------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Some instances in our collections contain nested subelements for :code:`holdingExternal` and the further nested :code:`physicalAddress` information.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To keep our metadata as simple as possible from a technical standpoint we will drop all information for :code:`holdingExternal`. This type of information has little additive value when :code:`physicalLocation` is already referenced.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/holdingExternal`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will drop all information for :code:`holdingExternal`.

        skos:note "Shelf locator: Manuscript Number 5" .

physicalLocation with @displayLabel="Address"
---------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Some of items with the :code:`physicalLocation` of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity also have a :code:physicalLocation subelement with the :code:`displayLabel` attribute value of "Address".

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to the :code:`holdingExternal`, we will opt drop this information to maintain simplicity of our data from a technical standpoint.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="Address"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Drop this.

physicalLocation with @displayLabel="Collection"
------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

In a some collections for Arrowmont, we will find items having a :code:`physicalLocation` subelement with the :code:`displayLabel` attribute value of "Collection" with text containing "Archives Collection". We also have extra :code:`physicalLocation` subelements with :code:`displayLabel` attribute values of "Detailed Location", "City" and "State".

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because these records do not already have a `dbo:collection` predicate, we will transcribe the string literal to `dbo:collection` for :code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="Collection"]`. No other data here needs to be retained and will be dropped.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="Collection" and text()[contains(.,"Archives Collection")]]`
:code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="Repository"]`
:code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="Detailed Location"]`
:code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="City"]`
:code:`location/physicalLocation[@displayLabel="State"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

We will keep the string for the :code:`physicalLocation` instance with :code:`displayLabel="Collection"` and transcribe this to literal for `dbo:collection`.

Similar to when :code:`physicalLocation` has no :code:`displayLabel` attribute, :code:`physicalLocation` with an :code:`displayLabel` attribute value of "Repository" is retained as `relators:rps`.

All other :code:`physicalLocation` ("Detailed Location", "City", "State") data is dropped.

physicalLocation within volvoices used for provider information
---------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

There is one collection in which location information needs to be used to correct inaccuracies for other metadata fields. The Volunteer Voices collection lists the University of Tennessee as the :code:`recordContentSource` for all records. While UT may have created the metadata records, our mapping with DPLA makes it so that we are noted as the source of these records rather than the actual contributing institution. There are instances within volvoices in which the institution in physicalLocation and the one listed in recordContent Source are the same. This action doesn't need to be taken for those records.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Providing contributing institutions with the proper credit is important for inter-institutional projects.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/physicalLocation[. != recordInfo/recordContentSource]`

Note: an easier way to resolve this particular XPath expression might be to start at the document node, :code:`mods`; e.g. :code:`mods[location/physicalLocation != recordInfo/recordContentSource]`.

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Will be mapped to both `relators:rps` and `edm:dataProvider`. `edm:dataProvider` is being used because the value is an "organisation who contributes data indirectly to an aggregation service" (aka to UT first and then to DPLA).

Here's an example record -

`Example record - volvoices:2737 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A2737/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

        relators:rps "Chattanooga-Hamilton County Bicentennial Library" .

url
---

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Some of our metadata for volvoices may contain self-referential URL locations. The data contained in these directly reference objects in our current Islandora 7 build and the object’s datastreams.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is self-referential and has no value in a new system.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`location/url`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

`Example record - volvoices:9999 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9999/datastream/MODS/view>`_

recordIdentifier
----------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

Unremediated records often contain identifiers for the record. These take a couple of different forms. The Heilman
collection and Volunteer Voices collections contain this element. In Volunteer Voices the identifier is simply the adminDB
value with 'record' appended to the beginning (`e.g. volvoices:2352 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A2352/datastream/MODS/view>`_).

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the basic root of the :code:`recordIdentifier` value is already present in the :code:`identifier` element in all cases and the
:code:`recordIdentifier` value is never used on its own, there is no reason to retain these values.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/recordIdentifier`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

All :code:`recordIdentifier` values should be dropped, so no RDF example is included below.

Here's an `example record - heilman:1001 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/heilman%3A1001/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <identifier type="local">Pseudolarix_0858</identifier>
    <recordInfo>
        <recordIdentifier>record_Pseudolarix_0858</recordIdentifier>
    </recordInfo>

languageOfCataloging
--------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

All of the recently migrated SCOUT to TEI collections (e.g. American Civil War Collection, Tennessee Documentary History, etc.)
as well as some of UT's less recent collections (e.g. Sanborn, mpabaker, etc.) contain the element :code:`languageOfCataloging`.
In total, it is found in approximately 6,000 records. Note that in all cases the language is English, but this information
is represented as both a code ("eng") and a text value ("English").

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently :code:`languageOfCataloging` is not publicly displayed anywhere outside of the MODS XML. The values of this element
do have the potential to be used if UT has materials that might warrant cataloging in another language, but currently
this is not the case. An example of a project that includes two records, one catalogued in Spanish and one in English, is
`UNC's New Roots / Nuevas Raíces <https://newroots.lib.unc.edu/>`_. While UT may want to pursue a project like this in the
future, presently it seems unlikely that it will. More importantly, if such a project became a priority, it would not be
difficult to distinguish via code UT's existing English records from records in another language. If we did want to create
a project like this, information on the language of cataloging could be added across the repository with minimal effort.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/languageOfCataloging`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Since we are not currently utilizing these values in any way, these should be dropped in the mapping.

`Example record - sanborn:1002 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/sanborn%3A1002/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <recordInfo>
        <languageOfCataloging>
            <languageTerm authority="iso639-2b" type="code">eng</languageTerm>
        </languageOfCataloging>
    </recordInfo>

recordOrigin
------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The :code:`recordOrigin` element includes information about what methods or transformations were used to prepare a record. There
are six different distinct values in UT's metadata.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because the existing values all relate to MODS XML, the string values present will no longer be applicable in a RDF-based
platform. Discussion indicated that there might be some use for the general property of :code:`recordOrigin` if a link to this
mapping document or some other relevant resource was shared in place of the existing values. This administrative information
could also be shared on the Digital Collections website or elsewhere rather than the record. As a convincing argument
was not made that this information is essential, it was decided to drop these values

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/recordOrigin`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

`Example record - cDanielCartoon:1178 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/cDanielCartoon%3A1178/datastream/MODS/view>`_

.. code-block:: xml

    <recordInfo>
        <recordOrigin>Created and edited in general conformance to MODS Guidelines (Version 3.5).</recordOrigin>
    </recordInfo>

recordChangeDate
----------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This element is used sparingly in UT's metadata records. Currently there are five distinct values, all indicating that the
last change to the record was made in 2015, which simply isn't sharing accurate information.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keeping this information is not be useful as it doesn't allow someone viewing the record to see when it was actually
last updated. Inaccurate information is shared. In addition, in a system like Islandora it's easy enough for an internal
staff member to view when the metadata datastream has been updated without tracking this in the record. This element can
be dropped.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/recordChangeDate`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

`Example record - volvoices:3435 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A3435/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <recordInfo>
        <recordChangeDate encoding="edtf">2015-03-23</recordChangeDate>
        <recordChangeDate encoding="edtf">2015-03-31</recordChangeDate>
        <recordChangeDate encoding="edtf">2015-04-01</recordChangeDate>
    </recordInfo>

recordCreationDate
------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

A total of 167 values are present for :code:`recordCreationDate`. This value shows when the record was originally created. All
but one of these values precedes 2010. All of the recently migrated TEI SCOUT records (2,386) have a value of
"2020-04-23-04:00". This is the only value not presented in EDTF format. Otherwise all of the values appear to come from
Volunteer Voices.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike :code:`recordChangeDate`, all of the values within :code:`recordCreationDate` are at least accurate. Currently this information
is not used or displayed for users. Given this and the fact that this element is present in a very small percentage of
UT records, it does not seem useful to keep this information. Again, a repository system should have a way to track
when a metadata datastream for a particular digital object was created. Therefore keeping this information adds unnecessary
complexity.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/recordCreationDate`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Do not migrate.

`Example record - volvoices:1857 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A1857/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <recordInfo>
        <recordCreationDate encoding="edtf">2007-10-26</recordCreationDate>
    </recordInfo>

recordContentSource - University of Tennessee, Knoxville as value
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

The :code:`recordContentSource` element is one of the most essential elements within :code:`recordInfo`, as we currently use it to
communicate the provider in DPLA. Because DPLA cannot handle URIs, the decision has been made to only deliver strings.
We do not feel strongly that the added functionality provided by using a URI for this field warrants the effort needed
to process URIs into strings for delivery to DPLA. We recognize that this goes against our general philosophy to use URIs
when possible.

To better understand UT's use of this element some background information is helpful. At UT the information we share in
this element is not consistent with the definition of :code:`recordContentSource` - "The code or name of the entity (e.g. an
organization and/or database) that either created or modified the original record." While we work with other partners,
like the Children's Defense Fund and the McClung Museum, we are still technically the creators of the records in these
situations. Despite this, we typically list these institutions as the record creator because we set up :code:`recordContentSource`
as the element that DPLA should map to for content provider. In actuality, when the content provider is not UT, this
information should be communicated in :code:`physicalLocation` and our DPLA mapping should be updated. Despite these semantic
issues, UT has consistently put this information in an incorrect element, so the mapping is not affected.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A content provider is required in DPLA. This value also provides UT with the opportunity to attribute collections to
the institution that provided them, which is important for maintaining respectful relationships. Because of DPLA's
limitations, we will provide this information as a string.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/recordContentSource`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

Because UT acts as a service hub for DPLA and it delivers data directly to this aggregator, it can be considered an
`edm:provider`. This is defined as "The name or identifier of the organization who delivers data directly to an aggregation
service (e.g. Europeana)."

When UT physically holds the material and created the record, the metadata resembles this `example record - acwiley:284 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/acwiley%3A284/datastream/MODS/view>`_.

.. code-block:: xml

    <recordInfo>
        <recordContentSource valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n87808088">University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Libraries</recordContentSource>
    </recordInfo>

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix edm: <http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/> .

        <https://example.org/objects/1> edm:provider "University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Libraries" .

recordContentSource - not University of Tennessee, Knoxville as value
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

When a resource comes from a non-UT institution, its name is typically placed in :code:`recordContentSource`. An exception to
this is Volunteer Voices, which only includes the contributing institution in :code:`location/physicalLocation`. See
:code:`location` for more information.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A content provider is required in DPLA. Sharing the names of institutional partners within the Digital Library of Tennessee
is also a great way to recognize the contributions of these libraries. Because of DPLA's limitations, we will provide
this information as a string.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`recordInfo/recordContentSource`

Decision
^^^^^^^^

When the institution listed as providing the information is not UT, `edm:dataProvider` should be used instead of
`edm:provider`. `edm:dataProvider` is defined as "The name or identifier of the organisation who contributes data indirectly
to an aggregation service."

`Example record - cdf:70 <https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/cdf%3A70/datastream/MODS/view>`_.
It is also coupled with an "Intermediate Provider" note, as shown below. McClung's Egypt collection is also treated similarly.

.. code-block:: xml

    <recordInfo>
        <recordContentSource valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2017113530">Langston Hughes Library (Children's Defense Fund Haley Farm)</recordContentSource>
    </recordInfo>
    <note displayLabel="Intermediate Provider">University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Libraries</note>
    <location>
        <physicalLocation valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2017113530">Langston Hughes Library (Children's Defense Fund Haley Farm)</physicalLocation>
    </location>

For the purposes of DPLA, we only need the :code:`recordContentSource` value and not also the :code:`physicalLocation` value. Because
these institutions are not directly contributing to DPLA, they are listed as an `edm:dataProvider` instead of an `edm:provider`.

.. code-block:: turtle

    @prefix edm: <http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/> .

        <https://example.org/objects/1> edm:dataProvider "Langston Hughes Library (Children's Defense Fund Haley Farm)" .

accessCondition - Rights Statements and Creative Commons Licenses
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

This category is defined by the presence of either one of the twelve standardized rights statements from `https://righsstatements.org <https://righsstatements.org>`_
or one of the CC licenses. These values are used to provide users with standard and clear information on the copyright
status of an item and how or if it can be reused. These values are currently displayed in a facet and are recommended for
sharing with DPLA.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DPLA maps both CC licenses and Rights Statements to `edm:rights`. So does Samvera. Presently only the Heilman Collection includes
a CC license.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`accessCondition[@xlink:href]`

accessCondition - Restrictions on Access
----------------------------------------

Use case
^^^^^^^^

The Howard Baker Audiovisual Collection includes 46 items that are "In Copyright" and therefore have restricted access to
avoid any potential copyright conflicts. Only on campus access is provided to the actual recordings, though the metadata
records are accessible from anywhere. Having the metadata accessible makes it so that anyone can discover these materials
and decide for themselves if it is worth a trip into campus. Some of the recordings had some deterioration and were therefore
digitized as a preservation measure. Having digitized copies also made providing on site access easier. In order to make
sure that users are aware of the on campus only restriction, a note needed to be added to the metadata. When off campus
users visit the metadata, this note makes it clear why they cannot access the recording.

Justification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the value present in the current :code:`accessCondition` node is not associated with a controlled vocabulary and simply needs to
be displayed to the user within the record, there is no reason to connect it with other :code:`accessCondition` values. A note is
sufficient for this use case.

XPath
^^^^^

:code:`accessCondition[@type="restriction on access"]`

Decision
^^^^^^^^
